Swedish Meatballs
About 8 servings

Basic gravy:
1 stick of butter
½ c. flour
salt and pepper, thyme (optional)
2 1/2 T. beef base
3-4 c. water 
A little cream (optional)
~2 lb. meatballs

While meatballs are cooking (bake them following the directions on the package), melt butter in large frying pan and add flour.  Cook over medium heat, stirring nearly constantly, until the mixture starts to change color.  Add salt and pepper and thyme if desired.  

Stir in beef base and water, a cup at a time.  Bring to boil so it thickens.  Add water as necessary and a little cream if desired.  Reduce heat once it’s thick and the right consistency.  Stir often and add cooked meatballs.  Add more liquid if it’s too thick.
